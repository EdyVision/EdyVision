## Hi there, I'm Eidan ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer by day and by night, I'm a writer and Ph.D student currently diving into psychological and social factors in information disclosure patterns and detection on social media. In the past, I've worked on a number of serverless and website projects that I've since open sourced. Work experience includes enterprise API development, distributed network systems, and flight training simulators.
